        <section id="introsection">
            <p>Growing up Cuban, empanadas and other pastelitos were something that I eat a lot and absolutely loved. 
            Different Latin cultures have their own take on an empanada, meaning they come in many shapes and flavors. 
            This recipe is a good start and I welcome you to make changes or add ingredients to fit your taste!
            <br><br>
            Recently my girlfriend and I visited her sister and brother-in-law at their new home. 
            While we were there, they cooked us some delicious empanadas which reminded me of my childhood watching my mom and other family members cook them. 
            After this my girlfriend and I started cooking these at home ourselves and is why I decided to share this recipe with you.</p>

                        <li>For your dough, you can buy ready to be cooked empanada dough from the store or you can make your own dough. 
                            But to make your own dough you will need to look-up recipes for that <a href="https://thenovicechefblog.com/empanada-dough/">online</a>.</li>
                        <li>For your chicken any cooking method would suffice. Some methods that work well are pan/skillet, poach, and baking. 
                            Just keep in mind this may influence how you season your chicken.</li>
